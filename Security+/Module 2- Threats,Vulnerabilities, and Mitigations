  unsecure networks-wired, wireless
  supply chains(managed service providers, vendors, suppliers)
  social engineering


1.3 Social Engineering (part 1)
What is social engineering: impersonation in order to gian access or information
  non-techincal means of gaining access to resources without being subjected to normal means of authentication
  socail engineers often use impersonation of an authorized party to gain trust or access
  according to Webroot Inc., social engineering is responsible for approximately 93% of data breaches at financial institutions
Socail Enginneering Attacks
  Phisihing: an attempt by unauthorized entities posing as legitimate individuals, usually via email, to obtain sensitive information from an indiscriminate group of individuals."if you case a large enough net, you're going to catch some fish".
    sperar phsihing:phishing targeted to a specific group, organization, or demographic
      whaling: a type of spear phishing geared towward the senior leaders of a organization
    vishing/Smishing:VOIP or SMS phishing
  Spam: unrequested bulk messages sent in large quantities
  SPIM: spam of instant messaging
  Bluejacking: spam over bluetooth
  Prepending: adding information to a message to legitimize a message. For instance, adding "Re:" in the subject line makes it look like the message is a reply
  Pretexting: An attacker presents a fabrication of a legitimate reasonthey would need access to a system or resource even thought they've nor been granted access
  Identity Fraud: Using information(often obtained through social engineering attacks) to present oneself as another. Loans and even mortgages are often fraudulently obtained through this means
  Invoice Scams: sending invoices purporting to be from legitimate companies in hipes that they will  be paid without further investigation
  Hoaxes: chiain letters, promises of financial gain are types of hoaxes. Other hoaxes may suggest a user delete files or perform an action for what seems like legitimate reason.
  Credential harvesting: specifically designed ot steal account and authentication credentials
  Reconnaissance Attack: using publicly available sources to collect infromation
  Impersonatio: presenting oneself as another
  Watering hole attack: inject malware through an insecure, frequently used third party. For instance, if users of an organization frequest a less secure site, an attacker may be able to introduce malware through the less secure site
  Typosquatting: registering a domain name similar to a legitimate site in hopes that users will mistype the correct location and wind up on a spoofed site
  Dumpster diving: Retrieving informationform a user or organization;s trash or recycling or some other discarded material
  Shoulder surfing: looking over an authoriized user's shoulder hoping to see sensitive information like passwords or PINs
  Tailgating: following an authorized user into a secure area without having to provide credentials
  Piggybacking: similar to tailgating, except the authorized user wiilingly allows the arracker to access the area

1.4 Social Engineering(Part 2)
Influence Campaigns
  Large scale program, often launched by a hostile nation
  Greared towards swayign public opinion
  Often used in an attmept to sway election results
    hybrid warfare includes both traditional and socail means to accomplish the same military goals
    socail media is frequently exploited vy bots and used to spread misinformation
Principle(Reasons for Effecitveness)
  Principle used: Authority, Intimidation, Consensus, Scarcity, Familiarity, Trust, Urgency


1.5 Indicators of Atttacks
Malware Threat Vectors
  Threat Vectors: describes how the malicious code is replicated and spread
  Viruses: usually require a host file and unser interaction(filess viruses do not need a host)
  Worms: a memory resident type of malware that can self-propagate and does not need a host file
  Trojams: present themselves as a desirable application or tool, yt contain malware
  PUPs/PUAs(Potentially Unwanted Programs/Applications): software that is installed in addition to the app the user has chosen. sometimes callled grayware, as it is not necessarily malicious
  Other classifications are determined by the payload. For instance, a RAT(Remote Access Trojan) can be delivered by a trojan.

Unauthorized Access
  Backdoor: network software that opens a port on the compromised system. the host is then "listening" for traffic on the port and allows access to the system, bypassing normal authentication methods
  RATs: a type of  backdoor software that allows covert administrative access to a system
  Bot: an untomated script or tool that performs malicious activity
  Botnet: a collection of systems controlled by the same threat actor
  Command and Control(C2 or C&C): host or network that communicates with the exploited hosts
  Rootkit: operates at executive level or can be used to escalate privileges

Ransomware:
  Ransomware: computer-based attack that allows an attacker to extort money from the victim. May display threatening messages in relation to illegal activities supposedly performed on the compromised system
  Cryptomalware: encrypts critical systems or files and requires the user to pay a fee or ransom in excahnge for the key, which will unlock the encrypted files
  Logic and Time Bombs(not all malware runs immediately
  Time bombs wait until a specific date or time to unleash the payload of  the attack
  Logic Bombs wait until a logical envent, such as the tenth time a file is accessed, before delivering the payload

Spyware
  Spyware: malware used to track the activities of users
  Tracking cookies: plain text files stored on the user's system that can record pages visited, purchases made, shopping cart contents, search queries, etc., often used in conjunction with adware
  Adware: often reconfigures browers to target market to an individual based on previous activities. May reconfigure browser to load an adfilled home page
  Keylogger: records keystrokes

Attacks on Passwords:
  Dictionary: every word in a file
  Brute Force: every combinationof characters
  Hybrid: every word in file plus some frequently used character combinations
  Rainbow table: stored results from a brute force attack matched against the password hash. MUCH faster than running the brute force attack itself.
  Plaintext/unencrypted databases or protocols
  Spraying: attempting a common password like "Password1" to numerous accounts

Physcial Security Threats
  Malicious USB cable: can act as a skimmer over legitimate charging stations at public locations such as airports
  Flash Drives: can provide the means to distribute malware, as well as to remove sensitive infromation
  Card Cloning: making multiple copies of an existing card
  Skimming: installing a counterfeit card reader over a legitimate divice

Adversarial AI
  AI can be used to analyze activities of users and systems
  Tainted Training Data For ML: AI systems "learn" based on data retrived from customer systems and security devices like honeypots. By injecting spurious code or traffic into training environment, an attacker can corrupt the learning process, therefore rendering the AI software skewed
  ML Algorithms: ML algorithms can be targeted, just as others

3rd Party Attacks
  Supply Chain: compromising elements of a system provided by another party. For instance, if the processor is compromised at the vendor, then the system will never be secure. Could also exploit 3rd party access to a system or environment
  Cloud-based attacks: attacks at the CSP(cloud service provider)itself or protocols/apps/accounts used to access and transmit data to and from CSP
  Poorly written APIs(application programming interfaces)

On-Premises vs Cloud-Based Attacks
  Most risks are similar, but it is the location/responsibility for risk management that varies
    Facility Security
    Hardware/Software Vulnerabilities
    Malicious Insiders
    Weak Configurations
    3rd party issues

Cryptographic attacks
  Collision Attacks: attempting to create a cryptographic collision to identify another series of characters that will produce the same hash as the legitimate passwaord
  Birthday Attacks: attempts to cause a collision based on the fact that it is mathematically infeasible to cause a collisions with a specific hash, nad that is more likely to find two hashes that just happen to match, Again, mathematically infeasible but more probable
  Downgrade Attacks: requests access to the server at a lower level of security than the default in hopes that passwords would be transmitted in a less secure manner

Pass the Hash
  Password Hashes are storeed in protected memory on our systems
  if these hashes are accessed by an attacker(who would need administrative rights to do so), then the arracker may be able to exploit the SSO authentication to use the hashes elsewhere to sutehnticate
  there may be numerous hashes stored in memory, for instance, the currrent user, remote users, service accounts
  users should not have debug previleges or be administrators on their local machines


1.6 Indicators for application attacks
Code Injection: an attack where an attacker supplies malicious input into a program, and the program mistakenly executes it as code.(SQL,DLL,LDAP,XML)
  Input validationn and sanitization can be used to mitigate risk of code injection. Fuzzing tests application for weak input control

1.7 Cross-Site Attacks
Cross-Site Scripting:Persistent
