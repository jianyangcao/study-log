## 2.3 Social Engineering (Part 1)

What is social engineering: impersonation in order to gian access or information  
- non-techincal means of gaining access to resources without being subjected to normal means of authentication  
- socail engineers often use impersonation of an authorized party to gain trust or access  
- according to Webroot Inc., social engineering is responsible for approximately 93% of data breaches at financial institutions  

Social Engineering Attacks:  
- **Phishing**: an attempt by unauthorized entities posing as legitimate individuals, usually via email, to obtain sensitive information from an indiscriminate group of individuals. "if you case a large enough net, you're going to catch some fish".  
  - spear phishing: phishing targeted to a specific group, organization, or demographic  
    - whaling: a type of spear phishing geared towward the senior leaders of a organization  
  - vishing/smishing: VOIP or SMS phishing  
- **Spam**: unrequested bulk messages sent in large quantities  
- **SPIM**: spam of instant messaging  
- **Bluejacking**: spam over bluetooth  
- **Prepending**: adding information to a message to legitimize a message. For instance, adding "Re:" in the subject line makes it look like the message is a reply  
- **Pretexting**: An attacker presents a fabrication of a legitimate reason they would need access to a system or resource even thought they've not been granted access  
- **Identity Fraud**: Using information (often obtained through social engineering attacks) to present oneself as another. Loans and even mortgages are often fraudulently obtained through this means  
- **Invoice Scams**: sending invoices purporting to be from legitimate companies in hopes that they will be paid without further investigation  
- **Hoaxes**: chain letters, promises of financial gain are types of hoaxes. Other hoaxes may suggest a user delete files or perform an action for what seems like legitimate reason.  
- **Credential harvesting**: specifically designed ot steal account and authentication credentials  
- **Reconnaissance Attack**: using publicly available sources to collect information  
- **Impersonation**: presenting oneself as another  
- **Watering hole attack**: inject malware through an insecure, frequently used third party. For instance, if users of an organization frequest a less secure site, an attacker may be able to introduce malware through the less secure site  
- **Typosquatting**: registering a domain name similar to a legitimate site in hopes that users will mistype the correct location and wind up on a spoofed site  
- **Dumpster diving**: Retrieving information form a user or organization’s trash or recycling or some other discarded material  
- **Shoulder surfing**: looking over an authorized user's shoulder hoping to see sensitive information like passwords or PINs  
- **Tailgating**: following an authorized user into a secure area without having to provide credentials  
- **Piggybacking**: similar to tailgating, except the authorized user willingly allows the arracker to access the area

## 2.4 Social Engineering (Part 2)

Influence Campaigns:  
- Large scale program, often launched by a hostile nation  
- Greared towards swayign public opinion  
- Often used in an attmept to sway election results  
  - hybrid warfare includes both traditional and socail means to accomplish the same military goals  
  - socail media is frequently exploited by bots and used to spread misinformation  

Principle (Reasons for Effectiveness):  
- Authority  
- Intimidation  
- Consensus  
- Scarcity  
- Familiarity  
- Trust  
- Urgency

## 2.5 Indicators of Attacks

Malware Threat Vectors:  
- Threat Vectors: describes how the malicious code is replicated and spread  
- Viruses: usually require a host file and user interaction (fileless viruses do not need a host)  
- Worms: a memory resident type of malware that can self-propagate and does not need a host file  
- Trojams: present themselves as a desirable application or tool, yt contain malware  
- PUPs/PUAs (Potentially Unwanted Programs/Applications): software that is installed in addition to the app the user has chosen. sometimes callled grayware, as it is not necessarily malicious  
- Other classifications are determined by the payload. For instance, a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) can be delivered by a trojan.  

Unauthorized Access:  
- Backdoor: network software that opens a port on the compromised system. the host is then "listening" for traffic on the port and allows access to the system, bypassing normal authentication methods  
- RATs: a type of backdoor software that allows covert administrative access to a system  
- Bot: an untomated script or tool that performs malicious activity  
- Botnet: a collection of systems controlled by the same threat actor  
- Command and Control (C2 or C&C): host or network that communicates with the exploited hosts  
- Rootkit: operates at executive level or can be used to escalate privileges  

Ransomware:  
- Ransomware: computer-based attack that allows an attacker to extort money from the victim. May display threatening messages in relation to illegal activities supposedly performed on the compromised system  
- Cryptomalware: encrypts critical systems or files and requires the user to pay a fee or ransom in excahnge for the key, which will unlock the encrypted files  
- Logic and Time Bombs (not all malware runs immediately):  
  - Time bombs wait until a specific date or time to unleash the payload of the attack  
  - Logic Bombs wait until a logical event, such as the tenth time a file is accessed, before delivering the payload  

Spyware:  
- Spyware: malware used to track the activities of users  
- Tracking cookies: plain text files stored on the user's system that can record pages visited, purchases made, shopping cart contents, search queries, etc., often used in conjunction with adware  
- Adware: often reconfigures browers to target market to an individual based on previous activities. May reconfigure browser to load an adfilled home page  
- Keylogger: records keystrokes  

Attacks on Passwords:  
- Dictionary: every word in a file  
- Brute Force: every combination of characters  
- Hybrid: every word in file plus some frequently used character combinations  
- Rainbow table: stored results from a brute force attack matched against the password hash. MUCH faster than running the brute force attack itself.  
- Plaintext/unencrypted databases or protocols  
- Spraying: attempting a common password like "Password1" to numerous accounts  

Physical Security Threats:  
- Malicious USB cable: can act as a skimmer over legitimate charging stations at public locations such as airports  
- Flash Drives: can provide the means to distribute malware, as well as to remove sensitive information  
- Card Cloning: making multiple copies of an existing card  
- Skimming: installing a counterfeit card reader over a legitimate device  

Adversarial AI:  
- AI can be used to analyze activities of users and systems  
- Tainted Training Data For ML: AI systems "learn" based on data retrived from customer systems and security devices like honeypots. By injecting spurious code or traffic into training environment, an attacker can corrupt the learning process, therefore rendering the AI software skewed  
- ML Algorithms: ML algorithms can be targeted, just as others  

3rd Party Attacks:  
- Supply Chain: compromising elements of a system provided by another party. For instance, if the processor is compromised at the vendor, then the system will never be secure. Could also exploit 3rd party access to a system or environment  
- Cloud-based attacks: attacks at the CSP (cloud service provider) itself or protocols/apps/accounts used to access and transmit data to and from CSP  
- Poorly written APIs (application programming interfaces)  

On-Premises vs Cloud-Based Attacks:  
- Most risks are similar, but it is the location/responsibility for risk management that varies  
  - Facility Security  
  - Hardware/Software Vulnerabilities  
  - Malicious Insiders  
  - Weak Configurations  
  - 3rd party issues  

Cryptographic attacks:  
- Collision Attacks: attempting to create a cryptographic collision to identify another series of characters that will produce the same hash as the legitimate passwaord  
- Birthday Attacks: attempts to cause a collision based on the fact that it is mathematically infeasible to cause a collisions with a specific hash, and that is more likely to find two hashes that just happen to match, Again, mathematically infeasible but more probable  
- Downgrade Attacks: requests access to the server at a lower level of security than the default in hopes that passwords would be transmitted in a less secure manner  

Pass the Hash:  
- Password Hashes are stored in protected memory on our systems  
- if these hashes are accessed by an attacker (who would need administrative rights to do so), then the arracker may be able to exploit the SSO authentication to use the hashes elsewhere to authenticate  
- there may be numerous hashes stored in memory, for instance, the currrent user, remote users, service accounts  
- users should not have debug previleges or be administrators on their local machines

## 2.6 Indicators for Application Attacks

Code Injection: an attack where an attacker supplies malicious input into a program, and the program mistakenly executes it as code. (SQL, DLL, LDAP, XML)  
- Input validation and sanitization can be used to mitigate risk of code injection.  
- Fuzzing tests application for weak input control  

---

## 2.7 Cross-Site Attacks

**Cross-Site Scripting: Persistent**  
1. Adversary finds a site vulnerable to script injection  
2. Adversary injects site with malicious script that steals user's session cookies.  
3. User activates malicious script each time they access the site  
4. User's session cookie is sent to adversary  

**Cross-Site Scripting: Reflective (Non-Persistent)**  
1. Adversary sends URL with malicious string to User  
2. User tricked into opening link and requesting malicious URL from site  
3. Site includes malicious string in its response to User  
4. User's browser interprets malicious script as part of the legitimate webpage and executes the code  
5. User's sensitive information is sent to adversary's server  

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF)**  
1. Adversary forges a request for a fund transfer to a site  
2. Adversary embeds request in a link and sends it to users who may be logged in to site  
3. User clicks link, unintentionally sending request to site  
4. Site validates request and transfers funds from the visitor's account to the adversary  

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) takes advantage of a user's trust in a website.  
XSRF takes advantage of a website's trust in a user.

## 2.8 Timing Attacks

- Physical Access: Gain access to a location before security requirements are verified  
- Race Conditions: Technical in nature. Revolve around technical timing exploits  
- TOC/TOU: Time of Check/Time of Use  
  - Example:  
    ```
    3*5+10
    process 1: multiplication  
    process 2: addition
    ```
    Ideally, process 1 needs to be performed because multiplication takes precedence. Result = 25  
    However, if process 2 takes place first, the result will be different.  

- Replay Attacks: traffic is captured and then used again later  
  - Password Replays / Session Replays  

- Error Handling:  
  - System should fail securely  
  - Processes should terminate without further compromise  
  - Error messages should not disclose too much info

## 2.9 Memory Issues

- Integer Overflow: Values out of expected range  
- Memory Leak: Application does not release its memory as expected  
- Buffer Overflow: More entries than expected
