# 🛡️ Security+ Module 1 – General Security Concepts

---

## 1.1 CIA Triad

- **Confidentiality** → Keep data secret  
  - Issues:  
    - Social engineering  
    - Sniffing (unencrypted data)  
    - Media reuse  

- **Integrity** → Ensure data is not altered  
  - Mechanisms:  
    - Hash functions  
    - MACs (Message Authentication Codes)  
    - Digital signatures  

- **Availability** → Ensure services/data are accessible when needed  
  - Issues: DoS, DDoS, disasters  
  - Solutions:  
    - **Redundancy** → duplicate systems/components to avoid downtime  
    - **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)** → distribute content across servers worldwide for speed/reliability  
    - **Data Dispersion** → break data into pieces, scatter, and later reconstruct (security + availability)

## 1.2 Other Security Concerns

### ✍️ Non-Repudiation
- Proof of origin + proof of integrity → prevents denial of action  
- Provides assurance of sender + message integrity  
- Achieved via **digital signatures**  

### 🔑 Access Control
- **Identification** → Claim identity (username, ID)  
- **Authentication** → Prove identity (passwords, tokens, biometrics)  
- **Authorization** → Decide what actions are allowed  

**Access Control Models**  
- **DAC (Discretionary Access Control)** → owner controls access (ACLs, identity-based)  
- **MAC (Mandatory Access Control)** → based on classifications/labels  
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** → access via organizational role  
- **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)** → access based on attributes (user, resource, environment)

## 1.3 Security Controls

- **Definition**: Implementation/enforcement of CIA triad.  
- **Types**:  
  - **Technical (Logical)** → firewalls, encryption  
  - **Operational** → training, incident response  
  - **Managerial** → risk management, policies  
  - **Physical** → guards, locks, mantraps  

- **Functions**:  
  - Preventive  
  - Detective  
  - Corrective  
  - Deterrent  
  - Compensating  
  - Directive

## 1.4 Zones of Trust

- **Security Zones**  
  - Group assets into zones with different trust levels  
  - Interfaces between zones require access control  
  - **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)** → hosts public-facing services (web, mail, DNS) without exposing internal network  

- **Zero Trust**  
  - No inherent trust; each entity must authenticate individually  
  - Mitigates rogue processes/malware  
  - Often implemented by splitting network into **planes**  

- **Control Plane vs. Data Plane**  
  - **Control Plane (brains)** → makes decisions (routing, management)  
  - **Data Plane (muscles)** → forwards packets, enforces policies

## 1.5 Policy Framework (PEP / PDP / PIP)

- **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)**  
  - The “guard” → enforces access decisions, monitors connections  

- **Policy Decision Point (PDP)**  
  - The “brain” → evaluates policies and decides allow/deny  
  - PEP queries PDP for access decisions  

- **Policy Information Point (PIP)**  
  - Supplies additional info (user attributes, device health, environment)
