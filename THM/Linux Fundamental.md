# Crontab & Automation Notes

## 📌 What is Crontab?
- A **crontab** is a special file with formatting recognized by the `cron` process.  
- It executes each line step by step according to the defined schedule.  
- Each crontab entry requires **6 fields**:

---

## 📂 Field Descriptions
- **MIN** → What minute to execute at (0–59)  
- **HOUR** → What hour to execute at (0–23)  
- **DOM** → What day of the month to execute at (1–31)  
- **MON** → What month of the year to execute at (1–12)  
- **DOW** → What day of the week to execute at (0–6, Sunday=0)  
- **CMD** → The actual command that will be executed  

---

## 📝 Example
- Backup "Documents" directory every 12 hours:  

`0 */12 * * * cp -R /home/cmnnatic/Documents /var/backups/`  

Meaning:  
- `0` → Run on the 0th minute  
- `*/12` → Every 12 hours  
- `* * *` → Every day, month, and weekday  
- Command: `cp -R /home/cmnnatic/Documents /var/backups/`

---

## ⚙️ Managing Crontab
- Edit crontab: `crontab -e`  
- List crontab: `crontab -l`  
- Remove crontab: `crontab -r`  

Default editor is usually **Nano**, but can be changed.  

---

## ⏱️ Special Strings in Crontab
Instead of numeric values, you can use these shortcuts:  

- `@reboot` → Run once at startup  
- `@hourly` → Run once every hour  
- `@daily` → Run once a day (midnight)  
- `@weekly` → Run once a week (Sunday 00:00)  
- `@monthly` → Run once a month (1st day, 00:00)  
- `@yearly` or `@annually` → Run once a year (Jan 1, 00:00)  

---

# ✅ Quick Tips
- Use `crontab -l` to confirm your tasks are scheduled.  
- Always use full paths in commands (e.g., `/usr/bin/python3`).  
- Redirect output to a log file for debugging:  
  - Example: `* * * * * /script.sh >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1`  


# Linux System & Package Management Notes

---

## 📦 Package Management with APT
- The `apt` command is part of the **package management system** on Ubuntu/Debian.  
- It allows you to **install, update, and remove** software.  
- `apt` manages both the **packages** and the **sources (repositories)** from which the packages are retrieved.  
- It provides a whole suite of tools for managing software at the same time.  

---

## 📂 Managing Repositories (Adding and Removing)

- Normally we use the `apt` command to install software.  
- Repositories are sources that contain the packages.  
- Adding repositories allows us to install software that is **not part of the default Ubuntu repositories**.  
- Repositories can be added manually or with helper commands like `add-apt-repository`.  
- Packages can also be installed with tools like `dpkg`, but `apt` is preferred because it automatically checks for **updates**.  

### 🔐 GPG Keys
- Software integrity is guaranteed by **GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) keys**.  
- GPG keys act as digital signatures from developers.  
- If the GPG key does not match what your system trusts, the software will not be downloaded or installed.  

---

## 📝 Example: Adding Sublime Text Repository

1. Let's download the GPG key and use apt-key to trust it:  `wget -qO - https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -`

2. Now that we have added this key to our trusted list, we can now add Sublime Text 3's repository to our apt sources list. A good practice is to have a separate file for every different community/3rd party repository that we add.

2.1. Let's create a file named sublime-text.list in /etc/apt/sources.list.d and enter the repository information like so:



2.2. And now use Nano or a text editor of your choice to add & save the Sublime Text 3 repository into this newly created file:



2.3. After we have added this entry, we need to update apt to recognise this new entry -- this is done using the apt update command

2.4. Once successfully updated, we can now proceed to install the software that we have trusted and added to apt using apt install sublime-text

Removing packages is as easy as reversing. This process is done by using the add-apt-repository --remove ppa:PPA_Name/ppa command or by manually deleting the file that we previously added to. Once removed, we can just use apt remove [software-name-here] i.e. apt remove sublime-text
