# COMPSCI 204 – Usable Security and Privacy

## Lecture 1 Notes

### Key Ideas
- **Intersection of Security, Privacy, and Usability**
  - All three must be considered together, not separately.
- **Usable Security**
  - Combines security with usability.
  - Goal: security mechanisms should be effective *and* easy for users to adopt.

### Example
- **Graphical Passwords**
  - Different perspectives:  
    - From **security** → Are they resistant to brute force, guessing, or observation?  
    - From **usability** → Are they easy for users to remember and input?
